2. Extract the executable.
3. Download the gnop.tic file from Code.
4. Open with TIC-80, where you extracted it.

## How to Play
Player1 controls the red vertical paddle and the horizontal is mapped it.
Player2 is blue.

'Up' or 'Down' to move P2.

## Todo:
 - [ ] Add sound effects
 - [ ] Add background music
 - [ ] Add particle effects
 - [ ] Add camera shake
 
 ## How We Made It
 We wrote the code entirely from scratch in TIC-80 ~ which does make the process really easy,
 but we were accountable for each and every pixel. So, we did the math, and came up with the
 layout and everything. Then we wrote the code and tada! We know it's not fancy, but good for
 a game built entirely from the ground up!
 
 ## Why We Chose TIC-80
 We did not choose TIC-80, TIC-80 chose us. Given the fact that my laptop could not handle big
 engines like Unity or Unreal, we had to stick to something lightweight and something that Linux
 could handle without any issues. Also, TIC-80 provides rapid prototyping, so it was a natural
 choice.
 
 ## Challenges We Faced
 The major challenge we faced would be working together, since time zones differed by 12 hours
 and when 2 were online, 2 were offline. However, we did what we could and still managed to make
 a nearly finished game.
 
 ## End Notes
 It was a really enjoyable experience for everybody, and we learnt a lot. We had never used Lua
 or TIC-80 before, but today, we learnt both and made something out of it. From here on, the game
 can only be improved. It can be remade in a bigger game engine, and perhaps be shuffled to create
 something entirely new!
